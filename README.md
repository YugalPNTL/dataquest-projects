# DataQuest Projects

These are guided projects that I have worked on through the [DataQuest](http://www.dataquest.io) platform. I have earned both the [Data Analyst](https://www.dataquest.io/view_cert/GZELEICN10D6CCSNON26/) and the [Data Scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/view_cert/3ZQH2FG1H1ZTM4VEW9CU/) certificates offered on the platform.
