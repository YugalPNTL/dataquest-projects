1. Introduction

The approach of looping though each row and field takes O(m*n) time meaning it is inefficient and will not scale as data sets get larger.

Instead we should employ an algorithm that does this search more efficiently.


2. Linaer and Log Time Algorithms

We can get O(n) by knowing that the string we are looking for will appear in a specific column dn just searching this column. We can further get to O(log(n)) doing this with a binary search algorithm.

This is assuming the list is sorted by our desired column. In this case it is not so the complexity of the search algorithm will override.


3. Hash Tables

It was about the same amount of difficulty to search through a list of dictionaries as it was for a list of lists.

6. Possible Next Steps

Map out accidents using the basemap library for matplotlib.
Count the number of accidents by air carrier.
Count the number of accidents by airplane make and model.
Figure out what percentage of accidents occur under adverse weather conditions.
